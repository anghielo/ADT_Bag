Abstract Data Structure - Bag

Interface and implementation.
    - Add three methods: union, intersection, and difference to BagInterface.java for the ADT bag.
    - Implement the three methods,union, intersection, and difference, for the class ResizeableArrayBag and LinkedBag.
    - Write a client program, “ArrayBagTest.java”, which contains a main method to test  the  three  methods
      (union, intersection, and difference) you implemented for the  class ResizeableArrayBag.
    - Write a client program, “LinkedBagTest.java”, which contains a main method to test  the  three  methods
      (union, intersection, and difference) you implemented for the  class LinkedBag.
